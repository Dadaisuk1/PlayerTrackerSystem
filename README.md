## Maintaining Code Synchronization with GitHub
To ensure seamless collaboration and code integrity, follow these steps to keep your local repository aligned with the remote GitHub repository:

Add all modified files to the staging area:

```bash
  git add .
```

Create a commit with a clear and concise message describing the changes:

```bash
  git commit -m "Clear and concise commit message"
```

Fetch and merge any recent updates from the remote repository:

```bash
  git pull origin main
```
>Note: If your default branch is "master," replace "main" with "master."

Upload your committed changes to the remote repository:

```bash
  git push origin main
```

### By following these steps, you can effectively manage your codebase and collaborate with your team.
